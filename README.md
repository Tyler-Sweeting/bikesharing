# Bike Sharing Visualization

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to take a given dataset from a bike-sharing program in New York and transform it into a data visualization on tableau to present to investors that will convince them we have a solid business proposal.

### Results
I created 8 visualizations to present to the investors.

* The first image shows how many total bike trips there were for the month of August in 2019.

* The next image shows a bar graph which compares the number of bike rides to the hour of the day that the trip starts. 7am-9am as well as 4pm-7pm being the two peak times, most likely do to work commutes. 2am-4am is the slowest time, which would leave a nice opening for repairs to be done.

* Next, we have a map showing hot spots for starting locations of bike trips. From this it is easy to see where most bike trips are starting and great locations to set up bike stands for ease of location to our customers.

* The following image is a line graph showing the trip duration of our bikes. the average being between 1-24 minutes, with the peak being 5 minute rides. some rides do carry on for over 2 hours.

* Next, we show the trip duration but this time filtering by gender. Males seem to have the majority of trips.

* Below, is a heat map showing user trips by gender by weekday. The biggest takeaway I get from this is that subscribers are more likely to reveal their gender, where as unsubscribed cutsomers are more likely to declare their gender as unknown.

* Next is a heat map of trips by gender by weekday by hour. This shows that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday are busy days, and during the busy rush hours we mentioned above.

* Finally, The last image is a heat map that shows trips by weekday by hour. This reveals that we do get a fair amount of traffic on weekends, but weekends are busiest between 10am and 5pm. opposite of weekdays.

### Summary
From our analysis, I think it is evidently clear that a bike-sharing business has all the making to be a successful one. It shows the busy times as well as the slow times which makes creating a business model a lot easier. We can also see information about subcribers vs nonsubscribers. Other visualizations that we can make which might add even more insight for our investors is a graph showing how many rides a single use customer has before they decide to subscribe. One more would be how many miles our bikes have so we know which ones are due for repairs.
